# Colouring-Black-and-White-Image-Using-Keras
RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is the most popular color space, but in this project, we are going to use the LAB color space. LAB color space includes 3 channels viz. Luminance (having values between 0-100), A channel (values between -128 [bluish green] to 127[pinkish magenta]), B channel (having values between -128 [blue] to 127[yellow]). As our input is a black and white image (i.e. only contains information about luminosity) we will already have one channel with us, so only the other two channels will need a prediction. Whereas RGB requires prediction for 3 channels.
